## Introduction: From Single Agents to Orchestrated Systems

In Modules 1 and 2, we learned about prompts and memory for single LLM interactions. Now we explore **multi-agent systems** where multiple AI agents work together, each with specialized roles and contexts.

### What is an Agent?

An **agent** is an LLM instance with:
- A specific role or persona
- Custom instructions and context
- Memory of its interactions
- The ability to use tools or call other agents

### Why Multi-Agent Systems?

Single agents have limitations:
- Cognitive overload on complex tasks
- Difficulty maintaining multiple perspectives
- Limited tool specialization

Multi-agent systems solve these by:
- **Division of labor**: Each agent specializes
- **Parallel processing**: Multiple agents work simultaneously
- **Perspective diversity**: Different agents bring different viewpoints
- **Error checking**: Agents can validate each other's work
